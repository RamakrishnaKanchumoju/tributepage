                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on  15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015 was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007
               </li>
               
               <li>&#8658;
                He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering
               </li>
               
               <li>&#8658;
                He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts
               </li>
               
               <li>&#8658;

            <h3><u>Early Life And Educations</u></h3>
        
           <p>&#8658;Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul kalam was born on  <strong>15 October 1931</strong> to a <a href="#">Tamil Muslim Family</a>in the pilgrimage center of Rameswaram on Pamban island</p>
           <p>&#8658;His father <em>Jainulabdeen Marakayar </em>was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque </p>
           <p>&#8658;His mother <strong>Ashiamma</strong> was a housewife</p>
           <ul>
            <li>His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.</li>
            <li>Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.</li>
            <li>His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women.</li>
            <li>The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home.</li>
          </ul>
         <h4>&#10132;In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially <a href="#">Mathematics.</a>
        <h4>&#10132;He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.<br>While he was wroking on a project,the Dean threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished</h4>
